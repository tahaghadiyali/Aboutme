👋 Hey there!

I'm a second-year electronics undergrad – basically, I spend my days figuring out how all the blinky-lights-and-whirring-bits work. 

Here's what's keeping me busy these days:

*   **Machine Learning Adventures:** ✨ I'm currently playing around with machine learning, trying to see if I can make computers do cool stuff – like teach them new tricks (and hopefully not create a robot apocalypse! 🤞). You might find some of my experiments popping up here soon.
*   **Getting Down and Dirty with Hardware:** ⚙️ I've got a thing for the nitty-gritty bits of tech - you know, the kind you can actually touch! Embedded systems, microelectronics – it’s all fascinating to me. I'm all about exploring how we can make these little chips do some impressive work.

**My Side Quests (aka Goals):**

*   Level up my technical skills! 
*   Make some cool, useful stuff with circuits and code. 🛠
*   Find more cool tech peeps to geek out with! 


Happy exploring!

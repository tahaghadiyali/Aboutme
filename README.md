## Hello! :D I'm Taha

# I am an undergraduate student in electronics, currently focusing my studies on software development and machine learning. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring areas that complement my core focus:

Areas of Interest (Hobby)
*   Embedded Systems: I am intrigued by the integration of hardware and software and love to tinker around low-level interactions. ⚙️
*   Low-Level Programming: I also like exploring the fundamentals of computing systems, focusing on topics like operating systems. 🛠️

I'll be implementing my learings and sharing my work here. :)
